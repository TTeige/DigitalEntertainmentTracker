== README

To run this application please perform regular Ruby on Rails steps. Run "rake db:migrate", "bundle install" and other applicable commands to ensure your working environment is set up correctly. This version has been tested with Ruby 2.2.1.

To generate test reports run "rake spec:html" both for the main project and the gem 'thetvdb_party' enclosed as source in this project.

To work with TheTvDB external data server an API key is needed. For testing the 'thetvdb_party' gem requires a .env.yml file with an API key in the format "TVDB_API_KEY: '<key>'", the main project needs a .env file on the format "TVDB_API_KEY=<key>" (note the lack of quotation marks in the second format). Without these keys the application will not run. For educational evaluation these keys will be enclosed with the project.
